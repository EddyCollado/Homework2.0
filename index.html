                Welcome to my profile page! Here you will find a number of projects and assignments I have worked on. A little about my self, I grew up in Coral Springs, Florida, and I have been living in Colorado for over 3 years now. 
               
            <br>
                I enjoy PC gaming on my self built computer, playing guitar, hiking with my dog Atlas, and I am an asipiring Web Developer in training.
                
            <br>
                This portfolio will be for my on going projects throughout the course of this Bootcamp. I intend to use as many attributes and resources as possible to achieve clean, simple yet vibrant web sites that speak for themselves. I do hope you enjoy what you see, this is a work in progress, so please, stay tuned!
